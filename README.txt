# Simple-web-page-blog-of-places-in-istanbul
A web page block made on Node.js platform using JavaScript, MongoDB, Handlebars codes, with user login and venues in Istanbul.
The project is written with JavaScript codes.
Among the purposes of use of the MongoDB database, it is used to store the users registered on the web page in the data store and to check the registration information of the user in case of logging into the web page again. Another purpose of use is to keep the information entered to be displayed on the blog page and then to display this information on the screen by pulling it from the database.
The reason for using Handlebars is to make the written coding more organized and understandable.
